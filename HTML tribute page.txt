            It is true that Messali was a man and, as such, fallible. It can be added that his errors were the measure of his grandeur. History will one day judge of this. But the truth is much more rich, more real than all this noise and din. It seized them in order to surpass them. It is the heart that should speak, and that should make all the rest remain silent
